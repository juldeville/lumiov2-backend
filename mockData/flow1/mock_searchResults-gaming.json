        "description": "E3 EA SPORTS NX GEN - Madden Leagues: http://compete4ever.com/about Comments: http://compete4ever.com/forum/showthread.php?t=17796 - SUBSCRIBE, SHARE, LIKE, & COMMENT!\n \nCompete4ever is a competitive eSports community that expects great competitors to be great people too. If you want to test, sharpen, or improve your game in a fast, fair, fun, and friendly environment, this is the place you want to be. \n\nCompete4ever currently features online PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 leagues, tournaments, etc. for Madden NFL Football, and EA NCAA Football, with more games to come in the future. C4's main Madden leagues are Play-Now leagues that follow a 16 game NFL flex-schedule, that use the latest available rosters online; no player trades or anything similar are done. Their schedules are completely open; owners can play any opponents on their schedule at any time in the season. Each season lasts approximately a month long, with the regular season lasting 4 weeks, and the 5th week dedicated to playoffs. In July, we feature 32 team NFL-style NCAA leagues. Monthly tournaments are also held for C4 league members to play in. C4's Football gameplay rules are along the lines of Madden Challenges, and other major Madden tournaments.\n\nRandom \"drafts\" (team assignments) are always done for the first season of a game's edition year for all C4 leagues. For all of the other remaining seasons in an edition year we pick teams via NFL-style drafts, with an NBA style lottery to randomize the draft order of owners with the first 12 draft picks. If you join during a season in progress, you will be assigned an available team, with the least amount of games played, whose name comes up the earliest alphabetically (Bears, Bengals, Bills, Broncos, etc.). If there are no teams available, you will have a spot on the waiting list. In order to be on the waiting list, you must be signed up for this league as an owner without a team. Once a team is made available, and it is your turn on the waiting list, you will be assigned that team. A notification will be sent to the new owner as soon as a vacant team is assigned to them. Wait-listers must be prepared to take over any assigned team immediately. You most likely won't get your favorite team when you first join, but you can list that team at the top of your draft list for the following season so you can play with them, or a team close to what you want.\n\nOur leagues are also known to reach 100% user vs user schedule completion on a consistent basis. \n\nIt is absolutely free to start playing in the Compete4ever leagues, and prizes are also awarded. Last year we awarded at least $2,000 in cash and prizes to our winners. To join the Compete4ever leagues, go to: \n\nwww.compete4ever.com/sign-up\n  \n-Feel free to invite your friends to do the same!\n\nhttp://www.compete4ever.com/\n*LIKE Compete4ever on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/COMPETE4EVER \n*FOLLOW KOACHK on Twitter at https://twitter.com/K0ACHK \n*FOLLOW Compete4ever on Twitter at https://twitter.com/COMPETE4EVER\n*JOIN the Compete4ever community at http://www.compete4ever.com/forum/\n*To PLAY in Compete4ever leagues, tournaments, etc. JOIN at http://www.compete4ever.com/sign-up/\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nThis Sports video will show you:\nHow to find Madden NFL 25\nHow to find Madden 25\nHow to find Madden NFL 25 for PS3\nHow to find Madden 25 for PS3\nHow to find Madden NFL 25 for Playstation 3\nHow to find Madden 25 for Playstation 3\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -",
